# Shipectral

Shipectral is planned to be a port of the Shidacea core library SDCLib to the Crystal language.
This project is highly experimental and might not be completed at all.

# Installation

Note that this current version does only run on Windows 64bit.
You need to provide a folder third_party with the subfolders crystal, crSFML and SFML.

crystal needs to contain the crystal source code and a working Windows executable.

crSFML needs to contain the crSFML source code.

SFML needs to contain a recent Visual Studio 64bit SFML release with folders bin, lib and include in it.

Then run cmake using Visual Studio.
